# Changelog

All notable changes to **zbxctl** are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-03-06

### Added
- **Template-level user macros** (`macros:` block in template YAML). Macros are created, updated and removed idempotently via `usermacro.*` API — fully integrated across all commands:
  - `zbx apply` — creates/updates/removes template macros alongside items, triggers and discovery rules.
  - `zbx plan` / `zbx diff` — detect macro ADD, MODIFY (value or description change), and REMOVE.
  - `zbx export` — exports macros back to YAML for full round-trip Git migration.
- End-to-end tests for template macro lifecycle (`TestTemplateMacros` in `test_e2e.py`).
- README: template macro YAML reference and example.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- **Zabbix 6.4 / 7.0 compatibility**: `template.get` with `selectDiscoveryRules` silently returns an empty list on Zabbix 6.4 and 7.0. All discovery-rule fetching now uses `discoveryrule.get` with `templateids`, which is reliable on all supported versions (6.4, 7.0, 7.4+).
- `zbx export` — exported YAML previously had no `discovery_rules` section on Zabbix 6.4/7.0.
- `zbx plan` / `zbx diff` — discovery rules were always shown as "to add" (never detected as existing) on Zabbix 6.4/7.0.

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-03-06

### Added
- `zbx check update [name]` — refresh installed check(s) from the bundled package version. Shows file-level diff (new/changed files) before writing. `--dry-run` flag to preview without modifying files. Useful after `pip install --upgrade zbxctl` to sync check YAML to latest.
- `zbx status --watch` — live-refreshing dashboard using `rich.Live`. Displays connection info, resource counts, active problem count and last 5 problems. `--interval` flag (default: 5 s).
- `zbx status` now shows **active problems** count and recent problem list.
- `zabbix-compat.yml` CI workflow — weekly matrix test against Zabbix 6.4 and 7.0 using `zabbix-appliance` Docker images. Uploads JUnit XML artifacts.

### Documentation
- README: `zbx status` example updated with `--watch` flag and problem output.
- README: `zbx check` section updated with `zbx check update` examples.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- `zbx/agent_deployer.py`: SSH connect timeout was hardcoded to 30 s — now reads `ZBX_SSH_TIMEOUT` env var (default: `30`).
- `zbx/commands/init.py`: connection test timeout was hardcoded to 8 s — now reads `ZBX_INIT_TIMEOUT` env var (default: `10`).
- `zbx/checks/ssl-cert/check.yaml`: `test_keys` entry contained literal `localhost:443` — replaced with `{$SSL_TEST_HOST}` macro (default: `example.com:443`).
- `zbx/checks/jvm-jolokia/check.yaml`: description referenced `localhost:8778` — replaced with `{HOST.CONN}:{$JOLOKIA_PORT}`; added `{$JOLOKIA_PORT}` macro (default: `8778`).
- `scripts/check_apache.py`: status URL and timeout were hardcoded — now read from `APACHE_STATUS_URL` / `APACHE_TIMEOUT` env vars (consistent with all other check scripts).
- `.github/scripts/worker.py`: `REPO` no longer has a hardcoded `psantana5/zbx` default — auto-detected from `git remote get-url origin` at runtime.

### Documentation
- README: added env vars table (`ZBX_TIMEOUT`, `ZBX_SSH_TIMEOUT`, `ZBX_INIT_TIMEOUT`, `ZBX_PROFILE`) to Configuration section.
- README: `zbx init` fully documented in Quick Start (step 0) and Commands section.
- README: added *Customising check macros* example and monitoring script env vars table to Bundled Checks section.
- README: `owner`/`group` fields in YAML Schema Reference marked as overridable.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-06

### Added
- `zbx init` — interactive setup wizard: prompts for URL/user/password, tests connection, writes `.env`, creates `configs/` structure, updates `.gitignore`. Zero-to-running in one command.
- `zbx check install <name>` — now **copies** the bundled check from the package into your project (`configs/checks/<name>/`) before applying. Works after `pip install zbxctl` with no repo clone needed.
- `zbx check list` — shows **Installed** column so you can see which checks are already in your project.
- Bundled checks now shipped **inside the pip package** (`zbx/checks/`) — all 14 checks available immediately after `pip install zbxctl`, no repo clone required.

### Changed
- `zbx check install` no longer requires a `<host>` argument; copy + apply is the default flow. Agent deploy remains available via `zbx agent deploy`.
- `zbx check list` / `check info` now read from package data (always available) rather than requiring a local `configs/checks/` directory.

### Community
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`
- Added GitHub issue templates: bug report, feature request, new check, question
- Added PR template with checklist
- Added `docker-compose.yml` for local Zabbix dev environment
- Added terminal demo GIF to README
- Added PyPI/Python/CI/License badges to README
- Set GitHub repo description and 10 discovery topics



## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-05

### Added
- `zbx plan --output plan.json` — save plan to JSON file for later apply
- `zbx apply --from-plan plan.json` — apply a previously saved plan (CI/CD gating)
- `zbx host list` — Rich table with IP, groups, status; `--group` filter, `--templates` flag
- `zbx host create` — create host from CLI args (--ip, --group, --template, --port)
- `zbx host delete` — delete host with confirmation, warns if templates are linked
- `zbx macro list` — list all global macros; `--search` filter
- `zbx macro set` — create or update a global macro (upsert, format validated)
- `zbx macro delete` — delete a global macro with confirmation
- `zbx hostgroup list` — list all host groups; `--hosts` count flag
- `zbx hostgroup create` — create a host group
- `zbx hostgroup delete` — delete an empty host group (refuses if hosts are members)
- 4 new bundled checks (14 total):
  - `windows-agent` — built-in agent keys (CPU, memory, uptime, OS info)
  - `apache-httpd` — mod_status scraper (stdlib only)
  - `mongodb` — TCP ping + mongosh fallback (stdlib only)
  - `jvm-jolokia` — Jolokia REST API (stdlib only, heap/GC/threads/classes)
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml` — CI runs unit tests on Python 3.11 + 3.12 with coverage
- `pytest-cov` added to dev dependencies; `[tool.coverage.*]` config in pyproject.toml

### Changed

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-05

### Added
- `zbx status` — show connection info, Zabbix API version, template/host counts
- `zbx check list` — table of all bundled checks with item/trigger/agent summary
- `zbx check info <name>` — detailed view of a check's items, triggers, and agent config
- `zbx check install <name> <host>` — apply template + deploy agent in one command
- Multi-environment profiles: `zbx --profile staging plan configs/`
  - `zbx.profiles.yaml` with named environments (url, user, password, …)
  - `ZBX_PROFILE` env var support
  - `zbx.profiles.yaml.example` added to repo; `zbx.profiles.yaml` gitignored
- 5 new bundled community checks: **mysql**, **rabbitmq**, **haproxy**, **elasticsearch**, **kubernetes-node**
  — all with check.yaml templates, agent blocks, and UserParameter scripts
- Unit tests: `tests/test_models.py` (51 tests) and `tests/test_diff_engine.py` (15 tests)
  — 88 total tests (66 unit + 22 e2e), all passing
- `HostMacro.macro` field validator: enforces `{$…}` or `{#…}` format

### Fixed
- `zbx status` now reads API version from the already-authenticated session
  (`version_str` property on `ZabbixClient`) instead of calling `apiinfo.version`
  again (which fails with Zabbix 7.x when an auth header is present)
- `inventory apply` now applies host macros (create + update + idempotency)
- `list_hosts` now requests `selectMacros` so macro diffs are correctly computed
- Stale `scripts/getS3Storage.py` reference removed from `inventory.yaml`

 — 2026-03-05

### Added

- `zbx export` now captures `master_item_key` for dependent item prototypes
- Full end-to-end integration test suite (22 tests)
- PyPI package published as `zbx-tool`

### Fixed
- **B20** Dependent discovery rules failed to create without `master_itemid`
- **B21** Calculated item prototype formulas (`params`) were dropped on export/apply
- **B19** Tags silently dropped from items and triggers during export
- **B18** Item/trigger prototypes on existing LLD rules not synced on apply
- **B17** Agent diff showed missing local scripts as changes-to-apply
- **B16** Tags never compared in diff or pushed on update
- **B15** LLD filter conditions not preserved in export round-trip
- **B12** LLD filter not sent to Zabbix on discovery rule create/update
- **B13** Plan summary double-counted template field changes
- **B14** Bare integer intervals (e.g. `60`) failed validation

### Changed
- `pyproject.toml` package name changed to `zbx-tool` for PyPI
